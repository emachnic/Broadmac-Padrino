# Evan Machnic's Interactive Resume

I am a freelance [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) developer based in Tallahassee, FL. This is the source
for my site which can be found at http://broadmac.net. I used the [Padrino](http://padrinorb.com) framework
because it is a small site maintained by me and I did not need all of the features that Rails offers. The
site is also hosted on [Heroku](http://heroku.com) because I would rather write code than configure another
server.
